Create a Branch
  in order to create a branch, its super easy.
  All you have to do is use your terminal of 
  choice and type 'git checkout -b [branch name]'.
  git checkout is the command to switch branches
  and the -b flag says we're gonna make a new one!

Pull from a Branch
  in order to pull from a branch, you must switch 
  to the branch in question using 'git checkout 
  [branch name], and then type 'git pull'. That
  should pull down all the current changes to your
  branch

Push to a Branch
  pushing to a branch that already exists is
  as simple as making sure you have all your
  commits the way that you want, and then
  typing 'git push'. If the branch does
  not exist on a remote in GitHub you will
  have to type 'git push -u origin [branch name]'
